# Happy-New-You---WP10-store-mobile-app  
One of the earliest .Net applications I ever developer , around the beginning of 2015 , I developed this WP8 mobile application while 
learning software development using .Net Technologies.  
This application serves for personal development purposes, by suggesting several ressources of Motivation : photos, motivational
short texts or Quotes.  
--- The design of the mobile application seems pretty ugly cause that was one of the earliest apps I published to WINDOWS Store, I didn't 
know much about Mobile applications design  
#  Technologies  
Windows Phone 8.1 SDK , C# , Visual Studio, XAML, HTML Agility Pack, Sqlite
